# TURN
Assignment work.

Inspiration:

When I got the assignment, I started looking for ideas everywhere. From watching YouTube videos to browsing the Google Play Store. I eventually found a game called "zig-zag" on the playstore. I couldn't stop playing the game despite the fact that it had simple controls and gameplay. I decided to remake the core aspects of the game with the time I had left and with my knowledge, I was able to create "TURN," a game that provides a similar experience. I gained knowledge and had fun while working on this project. "TURN" will be an excellent game for any casual gamer.

Game Mechanics:

The game is an endless runner. You can only move in one direction, but you can change it by tapping the area displayed in the game
this makes for an interesting experience because the farther you go, the more difficult it becomes.
